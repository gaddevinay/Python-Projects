If you're setting up a Python project and need to install the necessary modules or libraries, follow these steps:

# 1. **Download the Requirements File**:
   - First, download the `requirements.txt` file that contains a list of required Python modules. This file specifies the dependencies your project relies on.

# 2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open your command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where your project is located.
   - Run the following command to install all the modules listed in `requirements.txt`:
     
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - This command will automatically download and install the specified modules.

# 3. **Run Your Program**:
   - Once the dependencies are installed successfully, you're ready to run your program!
   - Execute your Python script or application, and it should work seamlessly with the installed modules.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
